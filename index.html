                                <br/>
                                Yes, I met the course outcomes I set for this enhancement. By integrating SQLite, I demonstrated my ability to design and implement secure, efficient database systems for mobile apps. The app can now handle operations like storing user credentials, logging weight entries, and updating goal weights more effectively. The system ensures smooth interactions between the database and the app's UI, resulting in a better user experience. I'm satisfied with the overall improvements in both security and performance, and I don't have any updates to my original outcome-coverage plan.

                                <strong>Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?</strong>
                                <br/>
                                Enhancing this artifact helped me deepen my understanding of database integration within mobile applications. One of the key challenges I faced was ensuring that data flowed seamlessly between the database and the app's UI, such as when displaying the user's weight history or updating goal weights. I also learned how to write efficient SQL queries to avoid performance bottlenecks, especially as the dataset grows. Another significant challenge was securely handling user credentials. Implementing PBKDF2 password hashing taught me how to protect sensitive data while maintaining the app's performance. This experience highlighted the importance of balancing security, performance, and usability in mobile app development.
